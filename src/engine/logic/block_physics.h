//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>offset</td><td>The offset of the shape from the position of the body. The vector going from the body to the center of the shape.</td>
//    <tr><td>f32</td><td>rotation</td><td>The angle of the body.</td>
//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>position</td><td>The position of the body in world coordinates.</td>
//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>scale</td><td>The scale of the body.</td>
//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>velocity</td><td>The velocity of the body for this frame.</td>
//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>acceleration</td><td>The acceleration of the body for this frame.</td>
//    <tr><td>Vec2</td><td>force</td><td>The accumulated force acting on the object.</td>
//    <tr><td>f32</td><td>inverse_mass</td><td>The inverse mass of the virtual body, 0 means infinet mass and the object won't ever move.</td>
//    <tr><td>f32</td><td>damping</td><td>How fast the object should lose it's velocity.</td>
//    <tr><td>f32</td><td>bounce</td><td>When solving a collison, this decides how elastic the collison should be.</td>
